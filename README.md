​
### What We learned
​
Long story short we all learned a great deal about implementing the MERN stack in an application. We quickly learned how to allocate our efforts to highlight natural talents. Lastly we learned a good deal about git with different issues arising during pull requests and merges.

​
### Continued development
Some ideas we have for future features we want to add are: 

- ​Team leader
- Join multiple teams
- Light & dark mode
- Leaving teams
- Design
- Rate your teamates
- Game stats for each player
- Add unlisted games
